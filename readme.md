# RTTTL2GW
Convert RTTTL ringtones/melodies into GW-BASIC ASCII programs.

There are many computers that can run Microsoft Basic or GW BASIC. These old machines rarely
have access to new-ish songs and melodies (unless those crafted specifically for such machines).
Having a way to convert RTTTL ringtones (from old phones!) to GW BASIC programs enables these machines
to tap into a catalogue of thousands of songs.

## Usage
`python3 rtttl2gw.py input.txt output.bas`

There are no external dependencies. Not all RTTTL variants are supported.

## Test melody
Check out `tetris.bas`! It is actually an old Russian folk song, so it's public domain.

## Where to get RTTTL melodies?
Online! There are many sites, among which are [Blamba](https://blamba.de/rtttl/) and [PICAXE](https://picaxe.com/rtttl-ringtones-for-tune-command/) - note that we are not affiliated with either.

## Why it's not written in GW Basic?
Well, maybe one day I (or someone else) will re-write it. But done is better than perfect, right?
